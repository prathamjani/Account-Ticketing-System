# Account-Ticketing-System

In this assignment, I have created a basic ticketing system. Think of this as a tracking system for customer-reported problems. When a customer has a problem they will phone or email for support. The person handling the support request will create a ticket for the request that contains the details of the problem and the customer contact information so that the customer can be notified when there is a solution.
